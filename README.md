# INSPIREDIGITAL LANDING PAGE

This is the landing page of our family startup, ideally an all-purpose digital product company, but right now servicing Turkish doctors with full-stack web applications since we are connected with thousands of doctors, through my mom's decade-long content and copywrighting business, and my previous employment in Doktorsitesi.com which translates as Doctor Website, which is the counterpart of WebMD in Turkey.

## Stack

- Next.js - A React framework with hybrid static & server rendering, and route pre-fetching, etc.
- ChakraUI - Component and UI tool library specific for Next.js.
- FramerMotion - Production-Ready Animation Library for React .
